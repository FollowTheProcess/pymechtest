# Help pymechtest

If you use pymechtest and want to help, there are plenty of ways you can do that!

## Use it

First and foremost, the biggest thing you can do to help pymechtest is to use it in your work and let me know if you run into a problem!

If you think pymechtest should be able to do something that it currently can't: propose a new [feature].

If you've encountered a bug: raise an [issue] filing the bug report

## More Data

:nerd_face:

I gathered some initial csv's to develop the project against when I first started and I've tried to make the API generalisable, but to truly make it into a general tool that works on all sorts of test data I need your data!

The test csv files are found in `tests/data`. If you think you have a csv format that I haven't covered, create an [issue] or submit a [PR] to implement support for it.

## Create Issues

You can create an [issue] to ask questions, suggest new features, file bug reports etc.

## Create a PR

You can [contribute] to pymechtest by creating a [PR], for example:

* Fix typos in the docs
* Fix a bug in the code
* Add new features
* Improve the testing and CI
* Anything else!
